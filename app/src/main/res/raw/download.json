She also set a world record for opening partnership of 320 runs with Poonam Raut contributing.This beat both the standing women&#8217;s record of 229 (by Sarah Taylor and Caroline Atkins of England) and the standing men&#8217;s record in ODIs of 286 (by Upul Tharanga and Sanath Jayasuriya of Sri Lanka).</p>\n<p>As of June she has played 20 one day International matches and scored 737 runs at an avg of 52.64.

However, a late assault from Anya Shrubsole got her 6 wickets and caused a collapse of the Indian lower order, leaving the Indian chase short by 9 runs.</p>\n<p>India lose three wickets in the space of 4 runs to lose the World Cup, and England are the champions for the first time since 2009, and fourth overall.</p>\n<p>Shrubsole to Rajeshwari Gayakwad, <b>out</b> Bowled!! <b>Rajeshwari Gayakwad b Shrubsole 0(1). This is the end of the Indian innings. </b>Unlikely collapse, and England have won by 9 runs. This is heartbreaking for the Indian women, as they seemed ahead not three overs ago.</p>\n<p>Shrubsole to Deepti Sharma, <b>out</b> Caught by Sciver!! Mistimes a length delivery and strigh to Sciver. India are on thin ice here. <b>Deepti Sharma c Sciver b Shrubsole 14(12). Rajeshwari Gayakwad out to bat. </b></p>\n<p>Just three off the over. 11 needed off two overs with only two wickets left. Both teams have an equal chance here.</p>\n<p>Gunn to Shikha Pandey, <b>out</b> Shikha Pandey Run Out!! The umpires go upstairs for this but the timing of the dismissal have really made the final dramatic. <b>Shikha Pandey run out (Shrubsole/Taylor) 4(8). Poonam Yadav is out to bat. </b></p>\n<p>It is raining here, but India are ahead on DLS if that has anyone worried.</p>\n<p><strong>IND : 215/7, 47.0 overs; India Need 14 Off 18 Balls, Deepti Sharma Survives Stumping Appeal</strong></p>\n<p>Seven runs off the over, making it 14 off the last 18 balls. Jenny Gunn is back into the attack.</p>\n<p>Shrubsole to Deepti Sharma, <b>wide</b>, there is a stumping appeal. The bails seem to come off a bit late even though the stumps moved. The umpire has taken the call in India&#8217;s favour, this is a massive decision in India&#8217;s favour as a wicket now would have meant certain defeat. Sharma will live another day.</p>\n<p>Seven off the over. Shrubsole back into the attack.</p>\n<p>Alex Hartley to Deepti Sharma, <b>FOUR</b>, a straight loft over the bowler. This match still may either way.</p>\n<p><strong>IND : 201/7, 45.0 overs; India Need 28 Off 30 Balls As Match Heads To Tense Finish</strong></p>\n<p>Three runs and two wickets off the over. Shikha Pandey comes to bat. Hartley will bowl the next over.</p>\n<p>Shrubsole to Goswami, <b>out</b> Bowled!! Cleaned up. Balls manages to screw in under the bat and castle the stumps. It is not looking good for India here. <b>Goswami b Shrubsole 0(1). Shikha Pandey walks onto the crease.</b></p>\n<p>Shrubsole to Veda Krishnamurthy, <b>out</b> Caught by Sciver!!This is a big setback for India as the hitter is sent home and the tail is being exposed. This may be the end for India. <b>Veda Krishnamurthy c Sciver b Shrubsole 35(34). Jhulan Goswami comes out to bat. </b></p>\n<p>Seven runs off the over. Shrubsole back into the attack.</p>\n<p>Alex Hartley to Sushma Verma, <b>out</b> Bowled!! She tries to sweep off the flat of her bat, but instead drags it to the stumps. Not a great shot to try off the second ball, all she needed to do was support Krishnamurthy who is batting so well here. Sushma goes for a duck. <b>Sushma Verma b Alex Hartley 0(2). Deepti Sharma is the new bat. </b></p>\n<p>Alex Hartley to Veda Krishnamurthy, <b>FOUR</b>, Krishnamurthy steps out her crease and puts it over cover. She is driving the innings here.</p>\n<p>Nine runs and a wicket off the over. Hartley will bowl the next over.</p>\n<p>Shrubsole to Punam Raut, <b>out</b> Lbw!! In-cutter beats Raut&#8217;s defence and hit s her on the pads, right in front of the middle stump. The review did not help and Raut&#8217;s got to go. She misses a well deserved century here and India seem to be in just a little bit of trouble here. <b>Punam Raut lbw b Shrubsole 86(115).

      "rendered": "<p>Chelsea signed the most expensive player in their history by netting Alvaro Morata from the La Liga giants Real Madrid for a net fee of £70 million. This is one of the biggest signings as we head to the end of the transfer season, and is Chelsea&#8217;s biggest signing ever since getting Fernando Torres from Liverpool for £50 million. Morata scored 20 goals off 49 apperances in the last season for La Liga and European champions Real Madrid, but was destined to move out as he often found himself out of favour with coach Zinedine Zidane who preferred French international Karim Benzema. After news broke of the Premier League adventure in store for Morara, especially in his Chelsea&#8217;s famous blue colours, Morata was seen snapping pictures with teammates saying their farewell and wishing him luck. However, reports suggest that, shockingly, Benzema refused to say farewell to Morata in an indication of the bad blood between the two players who often had to compete for the coach&#8217;s attention and a spot in the starting lineup.</p>\n<p>Morata was one of the few home grown talents in the Real Madrid side. The Spain international was born and raised in Madrid, and progressed through the Real academy and the B team before he made his debut for the Real side in 2010. He shifted base to Juventus in 2014, where he won the Italian Serie A with Juventus twice. His sizzling performances caused his home team to initiate a buy-back for a figure of £27 million in 2016. His most recent stay at Benabeu has not been so good though, even though the side&#8217;s fortunes have gotten better and better with each season. Morata wrote a lengthy farewell on Twitter, stating that some will not understand his decision to bid his club goodbye for the second time, but that it was his decision and a new phase of his career. He also thanked the coaching staff, teammates and fans at the club for the last two years.</p>\n<p>Chelsea coach Antonio Conte has worked with Morata briefly at Juventus, and will be hoping to add some different flavour in his front lines with his addition.</p>\n",

If she meant one on the scale of the 1983 victory of the men&#8217;s team that put cricket right there in the national imagination and was arguably the beginning of India&#8217;s honeymoon with the game of cricket, she did not really say. However, India&#8217;s run in the tournament, where they got the better of England in the first game, South Africa and finally the Australian team in the last match. The victory against Australia means that the girls are peaking at just the right time in the tournament, with captain Mithali Raj on a roll as she always is. The Indian captain expressed the desire to take the World Cup trophy home, the first time for the Indian women&#8217;s team, and added that winning the World Cup would be just the shot in the arm that women&#8217;s cricket needs in India, giving impetus to all the young girls out there who want to take up and excel at the sport.</p>\n<p>Raj also added that it would give a platform for the team to showcase the kind of cricket they have been playing for about two years now. While it is true that the team has peaked, England have also done well for themselves after losing their opening game to India and it is going to somewhat hard to play the team on their home ground, given the extra motivation that comes from crowd support. Besides, England have won the tournament as recently as 2009 and there are still players who were present when England triumphed the world last. On the other hand, the Indians will be under a lot of pressure given that this is there second appearance in the finals of the World Cup, and also knowing that an entire nation will be watching how well they do come Sunday.</p>\n<div id=\"div-gpt-ad-1490771277198-0\" class=\"article-middle-banner\"></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

Harmanpreet Kaur&#8217;s innings was the fourth-highest individual score in women&#8217;s ODI cricket, and has drawn comparisons with Kapil Dev&#8217;s 175 against Zimbabwe in 1983 that arguably won India the title by keeping them in the tournament. Kaur&#8217;s innings was peppered with 20 fours and 7 sixes, and she probably would have scored a double century were it not for the rain interrupting.

After her stand with Mithali Raj, Kaur then got together with Deepti Sharma (who scored 188 against South Africa earlier this year) to put together a stand of 137 runs. In the 36th over, Harmanpreet decided to go for an almost suicidal double and her partner Deepti hesitated for the obvious reasons. Both batters went back and got to their crease in time, though that was enough for Kaur to lose her cool at Sharma in a very public outburst.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Is it <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ImHarmanpreet\">@ImHarmanpreet</a> or <a href=\"https://twitter.com/imVkohli\">@imVkohli</a> ? <br />Harmanpreet Kaur<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ICCWomensWorldCup2017?src=hash\">#ICCWomensWorldCup2017</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/IndvAus?src=hash\">#IndvAus</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/5ZIiZzF3QU\">pic.twitter.com/5ZIiZzF3QU</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; #VicY-786 (@IamVicySinha) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IamVicySinha/status/888060616992149505\">July 20, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Harmanpreet Kaur celebrated her hundred by throwing her helmet because Sharma almost ran her out.

Whatever I was thinking, I utilised. The plan was to watch the ball and hitting the ball. It was the heat of the moment (Deepti Sharma incident), I said sorry to her.

      "rendered": "<p>The two-day warm match between Indian and Sri Lanka President&#8217;s XI began in Colombo today ahead of the three test series against Sri Lanka. The Sri Lanka President&#8217;s XI chose to bat, and was tottering at 165/7 in 50 overs at the time of writing. Once at 138/1 and looking to post a decent score, the President&#8217;s XI were rocked by Ravindra Jadeja who spun his way to three wickets and a run out in which he was heavily involved. The Jadeja theatrics have bent the match in the visitor&#8217;s favour, and they will be hoping to get them all out before the day ends today.</p>\n<p>The practice match also marks the return of opener Rohit Sharma to Test cricket. His last test match was against New Zealand during last year&#8217;s home season, and he sat out the home series against England, Bangladesh and Australia. He then underwent a thigh surgery in London and made a comeback during the Indian Premier League this year, where he led his team Mumbai Indians to victory in the tournament. He was also the Golden Bat during the Champions Trophy in England, scoring in excess of 300 runs during the four matches of the tournament. He had been rested during the ODI series against Windies keeping in mind the heavy cricket schedule the team has for this season, but he will look to prove his chops in the warm up match keeping in mind the upcoming Tests.</p>\n<p>Also making comebacks are opener KL Rahul and pacer Mohammad Shami. KL Rahul will be eager to make an impression, as India is not short on openers with Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan both fit to play again. The slow tracks in Sri Lanka mean that India would probably go with a three man spin attack featuring Kuldeep Yadav, Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja. With his all-around skills on display today at the practice match, he is a shoo-in to the squad.</p>\n<p>The first of the three Tests will be played at Galle starting July 26.</p>\n",

Harmanpreet&#8217;s inning helped India to put a target of 282-runs in the 42-overs a side affair.</p>\n<p>But after Harmanpreet&#8217;s storm when India came out in the middle to defend the target, seasoned bowler Jhulan Goswami did something which had the capacity to overshadow Harmanpreet&#8217;s brilliance. The 34-year old pacer bowled an unplayable delivery to remove Australian legend and captain Meg Lanning, the ball pitched on off, seaming away on a very small angel and disbanded the wickets which eventually put India over the top in the game. The sight was probably the best moment of the tournament.</p>\n<p>Watch the ball of the tournament here:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">it&#39;s not often you see this &#8211; the number one ranked batter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/MegLanning?src=hash\">#MegLanning</a> out for a duck! <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/AUSvIND?src=hash\">#AUSvIND</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WWC17?src=hash\">#WWC17</a> </p>\n<p>WATCH: <a href=\"https://t.co/obWnfodPGk\">https://t.co/obWnfodPGk</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/OI4I3IiNwC\">pic.twitter.com/OI4I3IiNwC</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; ICC (@ICC) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ICC/status/888086948086243328\">July 20, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>While the match saw another best moment of the tournament when Indian captain Mithali Raj and Veda Krishnamurthy starts performing a happy dance in the middle watching Harmanpreet&#8217;s brutality.</p>\n<p>That was indeed a most epic match in the history of Indian women cricket history. India will now play host England in the semi finals at Lord&#8217;s. Lord&#8217;s has a great significance in the India cricket history.

Harmanpreet completely thrashed Australia by scoring over 60% of runs of entire Indian innings singlehandedly. Harmanpreet scored 171-runs off just 115-balls with the fabulous strike-rate of 148.70 hitting a total 7-sixes 20-fours in her inning. Harmanpreet reached her hundred in 90-balls but then Harmanpreet awakened the monster in her and scored next 71-runs in just 25-deliveries. Out of India&#8217;s 139-runs in the last 11-overs of the innings, 108-runs came out of Harmanpreet&#8217;s bat.</p>\n</section>\n<section class=\"cb-nws-dtl-itms\">&nbsp;</p>\n</section>\n<section class=\"cb-nws-dtl-itms\"></section>\n<section class=\"cb-nws-dtl-itms\">Earlier India won the toss and elected to bat first, lost Smriti Mandhana int he very first over, in the tenth over of the 42-overs India lost its second opener too when the score was just 35-runs. Then captain Mithali Raj and Harmanpreet made efforts to build the innings from there, after the end of 20 overs &#8211; nearly the halfway mark, India had only 70-runs on the scoreboard, both Raj and Harmanpreet were scoring at the strike rate of around 50-runs. Captain Mithali went back to the pavilion by the end of the 25th over, but after her wicket, the next batsman 19-year old Deepti Sharma, who was playing against the mighty Australia for the second-time only stuck on the crease for 137-runs with Harmanpreet.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, in the pressurising chase, Australian lost three early wickets at just 26-runs, However, by the end of their innings in 41st over Australia made 245-runs but they were never in the game.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">India will now play the final against host England on Sunday at Lord&#8217;s, a stadium where India won its first ever ICC World Cup in 1983. Indian women have reached the finals of the tournament for the first time after 12-years and only for the second time in the history of the ICC Women&#8217;s World Cup.

This is overall the fourth semifinal for India in ICC World Cup history.</p>\n<p>Australia has been the most dominating team in the cricket history whether it is men&#8217;s cricket or women&#8217;s cricket, they always have a giant record in all of them. Australian women have won 6-titles out of the previous 10 occasions and reached the final eight times. They have never gone out of the world cup without reaching the semi finals.</p>\n<p>Though Indian team has played well throughout the tournament, the matter to worry for India is that they Australia brutally assassin them in the group match. India won five out the seven of their group matches and came back very strong in the do and die game against New Zealand in the last group match. Indian bowlers bowled out the whole team of New Zealand and Pakistan inside 80-runs. While India will look to improve their batting performance if they want to win the crucial game against giant Australia, India will need to give their best today in all the departments.
